## About Me

As you can see, it's a low quality game and my English is **SHIT**.

I don't know what's the next time I update this game, but I guarantee that I will try my best to make it as perfect as I could.

This is my game of making a whim, but also my first. Hope you don't like it and tell me where should be modified.
